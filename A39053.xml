         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pikemen</hi> are armed with a head-piece, a Curace and Taſes defenſive, &amp; with a Pike of fifteene foot long, and a Rapier offenſive. The Armour is all iron; the Pike of Aſhen-wood for the Steale, and at the upper
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100667:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 84 -->end an iron head, of about a handfull long, with cheekes about the length of two foote, and at the butt-end a round ſtrong ſock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of iron ending in a Pike, that is blunt, yet ſharpe enough to fixe to the ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Musketier</hi> hath a head-peece for defence, a Musket, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of the length of 4. foot, the bore of 12. bullets to the pound; a Bandelier, to which are faſtened a convenient number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of charges for powder (ſometimes as many as 15. or 16.) a lether bagge for bullets, with a pruning iron; a Reſt for the <hi>Musket,</hi> with an iron forke on the upper end to ſupport it in diſcharging, and a pike on the nether end to ſticke into the ground; laſtly, a Rapier.</p>
            <p>Theſe Souldiers, both Pike-men, and Musketiers, are divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Companies; and every Company conſiſteth, halfe of Pikes, halfe Musketiers. The Companies are ſome more in number, ſome leſſe. Some reach to 300. men, ſome 200. ſome 90. ſome 80. ſome 70. Every Company hath theſe Officers of the field: A Captaine, a Lieutenant, an Enſigne, 2 Serjeants, 3 Corporals, 2 Drums; and for other uſes, a Clerke, a Surgion, and a Provoſt.</p>
            <p>Companies are compacted into Regiments, and the Regiments commanded by Collonels. Regiments containe not alwayes a like number of Companies, ſome having 10, ſome a 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. ſome 30. Companies and above. In every Regiment, are a Collonel, a Lieutenant Collonell, a Serjeant Major, all Officers of the field; a Quarter-maſter, and a Provoſt-martiall for other imployments. It ſhall not be greatly to the purpoſe to mention higher Officers than Collonels, my principall intent being no other, then to ſet downe the Armes and Exerciſe of our Nation, in the ſaid united Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Their Armes are ſpoken of. Their Exerciſe followes.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Exerciſe of a Foote-Company.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, both Pikes and Muskets are ordered into files of 10. deep. The Musketiers are ſometime placed before, ſometime in flank, ſometimes in the reare of the Pikes.</p>
               <p>To exerciſe the motions; there are two diſtances to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, when every one is diſtant from his fellow 6 foote ſquare, that is in file and ranke 6.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is when every Souldier is 3 foot diſtant one from the other, as well in file, as in Ranke.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100667:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 84 -->
               <p>And becauſe the meaſure of ſuch diſtances cannot be taken ſo juſtly by the eye, the diſtance of 6 foot betwixt the files is meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the Souldiers ſtretching out their armes doe touch one anothers hands: and betwixt the Rankes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the ends of their Pikes come well-nigh to the heeles of them that march before. And the meaſure of 3 foot betwixt the files is, when their elbowes touch one another; betwixt the Rankes, when they come to touch the ends of one anothers Rapiers.</p>
               <p>For to march in the field, the diſtance of 3 foot from file to file is kept, and of 6 foot from Ranke to Ranke.</p>
               <p>To order themſelves in Battaile, as alſo to goe towards the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the diſtance of 3 foot in File, and Ranke is obſerved; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to converſion or wheeling.</p>
               <p>The Musketiers alſo going for to ſhoot by Rankes keep the ſame diſtance of 3 foot, but going to skirmiſh they goe <hi>ala Disbandade,</hi> which is out of order.</p>
               <p>There is yet another ſort of diſtance, which is not uſed, but for to receive the enemy with a firme ſtand, and ſerveth for the Pikes onely, (for the Musketiers cannot be ſo cloſe in Files, becauſe they muſt have their arme at liberty) and that is, when every one is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from file to file, a foot and a halfe, and 3 foot from Ranke to Ranke. And this laſt diſtance is thus commanded, <hi>Cloſe your ſelves throughly.</hi> But it is not to be taught the Souldiers, for that, when neceſſity ſhall require it, they wil cloſe themſelves but too much of their owne accord, without command.</p>

               <p>Your Musketiers muſt obſerve in all their motions to turne to the right hand, and that they carry the mouth of their peeces high, aſwell when they are ſhouldred, as in pruning, and alſo when they hold their pans guarded, and come up to give fire.</p>
               <p>In advancing towards an Enemy, when they doe not skirmiſh looſe and disbanded, they muſt give ſire by Ranks after this manner.</p>
               <p>Two Rankes muſt alwayes make ready together, and advance ten paces forward before the body, at which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a Sergeant (or when the body is great, ſome other Officer,) muſt ſtand, to whom the Musketiers are to come up before they preſent, and give fire, firſt, the firſt Ranke. And whileſt the firſt gives fire, the ſecond Ranke keepe their Muskets cloſe to their Reſts, and their pannes guarded, and aſſoone as the firſt are falne away, the ſecond preſently preſent, and give fire, and fall after them.</p>
               <p>Now aſſoone as the firſt two Rankes do move from their places in the front: The two Rankes next them muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoulder their Muskets, and make ready, ſo as they may advance forward ten paces as before, aſſoone as ever the two firſt Rankes are falne away; and are to do in all points as the former. And all the other Ranks through the whole diviſion muſt doe the ſame by two's, one after another.</p>

                  <head>A manner there is to give fire retyring from an enemy, and is performed after this ſort.</head>
                  <p>As the Troope marcheth, the hindermoſt ranke of all, keeping ſtill with the Troope, is to make ready, and being ready, the Souldiers in that ranke turne all together to the right hand and give fire, marching preſently away a good round pace to the front, and there place themſelves in ranke together juſt before the front: As ſoone as the firſt ranke turnes to give fire, the ranke next makes ready, and doth as the former, and ſo the reſt.</p>
                  <p>We give fire by the flanks thus. The uppermoſt file next the Enemy muſt be commanded to make ready, keeping ſtill along with the body, till ſuch time, as they be ready, and then they turne to the right, or left hand (according to the ſight of their enemies either upon the right, or left flanke) and give fire all together. When they have diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged they ſtirre not, but keepe their ground, and charge their Peeces againe in the ſame place they ſtand. Now as ſoone as the foreſaid file doth turne to give fire, the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt next it makes ready, alwayes keeping along with the Troope till the <hi>Bringer-up</hi> be paſt a little beyond the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that file, that gave fire laſt; and then the whole file muſt turne, and give fire, and doe in all points as the firſt did, and ſo the reſt one after the other. A <hi>Sergeant,</hi> or if the Troope be great, ſome other better qualified Officer muſt ſtand at the head of the firſt file, and aſſoone as the ſecond file hath given fire, and hath charged, he is to lead forward the firſt file up to the ſecond file, and ſo to the reſt one after another, till he hath gathered up againe the whole wing, and then he is to joyne them againe in equall front with the pikes.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all the Troope or whole wing of Muſquettiers makes ready all together, and the firſt rank without advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing gives fire in the place they ſtand in, and ſpeedily, as may be, yet orderly falls away, all the rankes doing the ſame ſucceſſively one after another.</p>

                  <p>The Regiment of the Generall hath alwayes the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, the others alternatively and by turnes, and he that hath it this day; the next day after hath the Reare, the reſt following in the ſame ſort.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which command the Regiments are called <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</hi> The Regiments are compounded of 3; or 4 Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, (of 3 at the leaſt) and the Coronells Company mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth alwayes on the left wing of the Regiment.</p>
                  <p>The Captaines receive orders from their Coronels, as theſe from the Commiſſary Generall.</p>
                  <p>All the Companies are divided in 3 equall parts, which are called Squadrons, and diſtributed to the 3 chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; Captaine, Cornet and Lieutenant, having each of them adjoyned an old Souldier, which they doeknow to be of more deſert, called a Corporall.</p>
                  <p>Marching in the field, every Officer marcheth at the head of his Squadron, the Lieutenant excepted, which marcheth behinde with the Quartermaſter; and the third Corporall at the head of the Lieutenants Squadron.</p>
                  <p>The Companies are divided by files, and rankes, the file 5 deepe, and no more, how ſtrong ſoever the Company be.</p>
